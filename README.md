# Gyun Woo (woogyun.github.io)

Welcome to Gyun's repo. 
This repository is maintained by Gyun Woo (우균, 부산대학교), a Professor at PNU (Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea).
I lead the PL Lab (Programming Language Laboratory) at the School of CSE (Computer Science and Engineering) of PNU.
Most of the codes are for experimental and educational purposes.

I am interested in implementing languages for programming. Some of the Korean programming languages have been developed up to now,
but most of them are not maintained properly. I plan to port some of them one by one and create a new one to promote the readability and reliability of the programs.

Please visit the [PL Lab Homepage] or [Gyun's Homepage] for the details of PL Lab or me.

Thanks!
